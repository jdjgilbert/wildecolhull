Lais is a behavioural ecologist interested in the interface between sexual selection and parental care, and in using harvestmen as a model clade for experimental studies and molecular tools to answer research questions. She is visiting our lab for a 1 year internship while currently in the third year of a PhD with <a href='https://g-spotlab.weebly.com/people.html'>Glauco Machado</a> at the University of Sao Paulo.  She previously completed a MBA in Data Science and Analytics at the same institution.
