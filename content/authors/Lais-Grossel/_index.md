I am a behavioural ecologist interested in social behavior, sexual selection and parental care. In my MSc dissertation, using hormone dosages and social networks, I investigated how hierarchies of dominance could be restructured in the absence of alpha males in a Neotropical species of peccary (Mammalia). Now, in my PhD thesis, I am using different techniques, such as field experiments, molecular tools, and phylogenetic comparative methods to answer several questions about how parental care evolved through sexual selection in harvestmen (Opiliones). I will be part of James Gilbert's Lab as a one-year intern to study the evolution of parental care and the changes between different states of caring, culminating in the ancestral reconstruction of the first caregiver in harvestmen.

I'm doing my PhD in Zoology in the Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; I did my MSc in Zoology in the Universidade Federal do Paraná, Paraná, Brazil; and I got my Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences in the Universidade do Contestado, Santa Catarina, Brazil.
