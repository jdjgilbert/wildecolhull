I completed my undergraduate degree in 2023 in Biology at the University of Leeds. Having grown up in a bee keeping household, I was thrilled to undertake a research dissertation investigating the effect of honeybee queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) on fertility in male <i>Drosophila</i>, working within the Duncan Lab. Following this, I undertook a research Masters in the Duncan Lab, further investigating the effect of QMP on male Drosophila. This project primarily focused on tissue-specific gene expression profiles and feeding behaviours, using techniques such as mating assays based on GAL4/UAS crosses; feeding assays facilitated with custom designed agar well templates; and qPCR to investigate relative gene expression across a selection of tissues.

I am interested in 3D printing and automated data logging and have long enjoyed pursuing these areas both recreationally and to facilitate research work. Having enjoyed coding for many years, I am excited to be able to incorporate it into my research during the course of this project, especially in a field I have enjoyed exploring throughout my academic career. With my historic research focused on <i>Apis mellifera</i>, I am pleased to widen the scope of my work to include wild bee species and look forward to exploring the host of factors that pattern the development, behaviour and overall fitness of these species.
