Paula's MSc focuses on the decisions made by female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). She is asking whether females put more investment into eggs depending on the nutritional profile of the medium they lay on.  This is a novel test of the differential allocation hypothesis, which we will use to answer evolutionary questions about the evolution of parental investment in this species.
