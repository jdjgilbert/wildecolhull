Sam's MSc focuses firstly on how red mason bees structure the provisions they provide to offspring, by slicing up pollen balls and sampling the pollen across transects.  Secondly, she is working with local schools and orchards to investigate how pollen composition changes within and among cells and nests in different environments.
