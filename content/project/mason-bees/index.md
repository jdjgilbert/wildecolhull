Bees, managed and wild, are important globally for their role in pollination, which is central to natural and agricultural ecosystems. Unfortunately, bees are declining, partly due to poor nutrition. Despite this, we do not yet understand how bees deal with variable quality food in patchy modern landscapes. We know particularly little about larval nutrition, where all growth occurs. This knowledge gap has huge implications; we are changing available pollen resources for bees to feed offspring, without understanding how bees will respond. Bee larvae are unusual because all food selection is done by parents: the only nutritional choices a larva makes are how much pollen to eat, store and excrete. So, how do parents and larvae collectively ensure that larvae receive balanced diets?

Our lab has been conducting some of the first investigations of the nutritional ecology of larval bees. We use the Geometric Framework (GF); a rigorous, quantitative method for determining whether and how animals regulate the nutrients they eat. We are investigating effects of different pollen nutritional quality (carbohydrate, protein, lipid) upon larval consumption and development, at different environmental temperatures representing climate warming scenarios.

So far we have found that carbohydrate rather than protein is the main determinant of fitness – and bee larvae typically tightly regulate consumption of carbohydrate, but tolerate excess protein – patterns typical of predators, not vegetarian bees. Also, surprisingly, we have found that this pattern is only typical at normal or cooler temperatures. At elevated temperatures, typical of a climate change scenario, this rule is reversed: at 25°C, larvae stop regulating carbohydrate and instead regulate protein, tolerating excesses of carbohydrate.
