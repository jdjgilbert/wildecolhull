abstract = "Bees are important for vital pollination of wild and crop plants, but are in decline worldwide. Intensification of agriculture is a major driver of bee decline. Organic farming practices are designed to limit environmental impacts of agriculture and can increase bee abundance and species diversity. However, studies have been heavily focused towards some guilds of bees, overlooking others. This includes social brood parasites, cuckoo bumblebees, an understudied bee lineage. Little is known about bumblebee host and cuckoo population dynamics, and the effects of farming practice on cuckoo bumblebees have never previously been evaluated. To compare the effects of farming practice (organic vs conventional) on the abundance, species diversity, and community dissimilarity of cuckoo bumblebees and their hosts, we compared host and cuckoo community metrics across ten matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in Yorkshire, UK. As found by many previous studies, host bumblebees were more abundant on organic farms than on conventional farms. Despite this, cuckoo bumblebees were equally abundant on both farm types. Contrary to prediction, community dissimilarity and species diversity were unaffected by farm type for both host and cuckoo communities. **Synthesis and applications:** Results suggest that cuckoo bumblebee community metrics are not solely driven by host community metrics, and that cuckoos may respond differently from their hosts to differences among farming practices. This could, in turn, indicate that a unified management practice is not sufficient to conserve all bumblebee species."
